                <p>
                    I'm Dave Emmanuel B. Cabizares, but you can call me Emman, Man, Eman, or Nuel. I am a first-year Information Systems student at the University of San Carlos, Talamban Campus. I graduated from Divine Life Institute of Cebu, Inc., where I focused on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as my senior high school strand.

                    In my free time, I enjoy playing a first-person shooter game called Valorant and reading manhwa. I have a knack for cooking, caring for others, and even enjoy sleeping while listening to music. I believe in kindness and strive to treat everyone with respect.
                </p>
                <br><p>
                    I aspire to be an impactful person who helps others in meaningful ways. My goal is to leverage my education in Information Systems to create solutions that benefit communities and improve lives. I am particularly interested in how technology can streamline processes and enhance communication within organizations.As I continue my studies, I hope to develop skills that will allow me to innovate and contribute positively to society. Whether through coding, system analysis, or project management, I aim to make a difference in the world around me.
